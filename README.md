# how to use

## Full setup (as root on a fresh server)

Creates a user, configures sudo, and sets up the environment:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supermomonga/minimal-dotfiles/master/install.sh | sh -s -- USERNAME
```

If no username is provided, defaults to `main`.

## Personal setup only (as existing user)

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supermomonga/minimal-dotfiles/master/install.sh | sh
```
